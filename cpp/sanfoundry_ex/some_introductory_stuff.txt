Intro to C++ for Rachel


*** Exercises


1. Look at this program to calculate factorial
http://www.sanfoundry.com/cpp-program-find-factorial-recursion/

Notice: what is #include, and "cin" and "cout" for entry of data and printing out
        Look up "namespace"

Just FYI - same program without recursion
http://www.sanfoundry.com/cpp-program-find-factorial-number-iteration/


2. Look at this example for adding things to a vector
http://www.sanfoundry.com/cpp-program-implement-vector-stl/

Note use of << and endl. 
Note push_back to add to vector.


3. Look at this implementation of map
cpp/sanfoundry_ex/stl/map/map.cpp
which I got from
http://www.sanfoundry.com/cpp-program-implement-map-stl/

Find the bug in the following. To see the bug run it thus
g++ map.cpp
./a.out

It says

---------------------
Map Implementation in Stl

---------------------
1.Insert Element into the Map
2.Delete Element of the Map
3.Size of the Map
4.Find Element at a key in Map
5.Dislplay by Iterator
6.Count Elements at a specific key
7.Exit
Enter your Choice: 


Choose option 1.

It says
Enter value to be inserted: 

enter 12



Then it says
Enter the key: 

enter zam

 - it enters an infinite loop...







2. Get your head around this implementation of Knuth-Morris-Pratt
